Raddoon Rampage is a quick paced game of negotiation and strategy for 3 to 4 players.  Perfect for family game nights or for classroom environments, in this semi-cooperative game players have to work as a team to save Europe from invading Racoons while figuring out how to one-up their opponents.

>My friends and I had a great night playing Raccoon Rampage. It is fun, challenging and on top of it all, it looks amazing!
