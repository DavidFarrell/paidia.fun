The easiest way to learn the game is to watch this video (coming tomorrow!)

You can download the rules [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UyJcgG0IJSopPgfmYNDaRMrx9D0HcvmE/view?usp=sharing).

So far, we've mostly been teaching people how to play in person so the rules are quite new and haven't been tested much.

If you have any feedback or questions about the rules we'd love to have that feedback.
