Raccoon Rampage is a semi-cooperative game where players work together to stop raccoons from invading Europe and destorying all of our stuff.

It features a mix of strategic planning and social negotiation.  You pick policies to put into a queue, vote on policies *in* the queue, and dabble in chaos using action cards that manipulate things in your favour.  

What's unique about the experience is that *yes* you have to work together.  But you also want to *beat everyone else*!

Like Pandemic, you'll work with other players to stop the spread of a (ü¶ù) invasion.  But unlike Pandemic you individually want to win.  This means a lot of backstabbing that can lead to everyone failing, but if you play too nice... you're not going to win!

Key features:
* ages 12+
* 3 or 4 player
* 45 - 60 mins
* over 160 beautiful cards
* four storylines (that can be mashed up)
* a large game board
* four unique player roles each with a unique deck and player mat

## Four player decks made of policy and action cards


Each unique deck is a mix of **policy** and **action** cards.  On your turn, put a polic cards into a queue that you and the other players can vote on.  If a card gets enough votes, we move towards victory as a group but of course, each player wants *their* policies to win so they might not vote for you.

Each deck has a mix of standard and unique policy cards (black border).

Action cards let you *mess* with other players.  Whether it's stealing votes, swapping policies or manipulating the results of a vote, strategic decisions on when to play these powerful cards is crucial for success.

Every round a new story card is flipped.  These story cards put pressure on players to work together puts their personal goals in tension with the group mission.  Every vote counts - do we act on the story event for immediate benefit? or do we keep working towards preventing the invasion?
