![Play on Tabletopia](images/tabletopia.png)


You can [play our game on Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/games/european-bioinvasions-raccoon-68a54u/play-now). It's completely free. It should work on most computers and in most web browsers. 

We find it works best in Chrome. It's hard to play with a trackpad so try to find a mouse if you can.

The online version doesn't implement the rules of the game, so you'll need to run the game yourself.
