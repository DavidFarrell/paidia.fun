<p>A semi-cooperative strategy boardgame where players navigate alliances and rivalries to manage the raccoon invastion in Europe.

<h3 id="shades-games-and-engagement">Shades: Games and Engagement</h3>
<p>cf.me set out to change the way people get daily news by blending editorial content with playful, habitual
interactions. The company later rebranded as Shades News. We were engaged to design a cohesive
experience across the website and mobile app. We designed two iOS games that could act as lightweight,
daily touchpoints. &ldquo;baw&rdquo; and &ldquo;wurd&rdquo; were conceived as quick, replayable titles that complement reading
sessions—offering snackable play during news breaks and providing new entry points back into the news
experience.</p>

<h3 id="gaming-climate-futures">Gaming Climate Futures</h3>
<p>Gaming Climate Futures (2018) is a climate policy simulation we developed with Glasgow Caledonian
University students for UN decision makers that operationalizes the relationship between global
temperature targets and climate tipping points. Delivered as a mixed-media workshop—combining game
mechanics, structured negotiations, storytelling, and co-creation—it functions as a decision-support and
learning tool to deepen understanding of systemic climate risks while strengthening diplomatic
communication. The project was nominated for Best Game at the 2019 International Educational Games
Competition.</p>

                    <p>Paidia is led by Dr. David Gérouville-Farrell, who brings over 20 years of experience in technology and design-related fields. While at Glasgow Caledonian University, Dr. Gérouville-Farrell led a research team and managed projects totaling £2.5 million over seven years.</p>
<p>The research team specialized in developing serious games in collaboration with subject matter experts from other universities. Their work focused on game design pedagogy and effectively communicating complex concepts through interactive entertainment, while their academic partners contributed expertise in their respective fields. Notable collaborations include working with Purdue University and Oxford University on climate change simulation games designed for international diplomats.</p>
<p>Dr. Gérouville-Farrell has authored approximately 40 papers in the field of educational and serious game design and has developed and designed more than 10 games in this space. His expertise lies in translating intricate ideas into engaging game systems, including digital games, board games, and role-playing games. His skills extend to game design, computer science, artificial intelligence, and public science communication.</p>
<p>Paidia continues this legacy, consisting of Dr. Gérouville-Farrell and his former research team from Glasgow Caledonian University. Together, they partner with academic subject matter experts to transform research into impactful, game-based experiences that effectively engage audiences.</p>
