##### We need a partner

We are a team of game designers and scientists.  We've spent two years developing the game to this prototype stage, but we need a partner who can help us get it into production.

Ideally, you will:
* help put this into production at scale
* help market and distribute this game (to mainstream, educational audiences, and the TikTok generation)
* handle sales and revenue split

And in turn we will:
* promote the game at academic conferences
* enter the game into competitions and give talks about the game
* continue developing expansions and other content that can help you sell the game
