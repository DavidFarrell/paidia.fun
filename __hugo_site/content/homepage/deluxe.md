Feature notice: This section displays options to customize title:
- has a normal section title (`title` = "Raccoon Rampge: Deluxe Edition"),
- custom welcome screen title (`header_menu_title` = "CustomWelcomeTitle"),
- custom navigation menu title (`navigation_menu_title` = "CustomNav menu").

That is the important part, right? You want to know what I can do for you. This is why I put this right up there into the header menu of the website.
