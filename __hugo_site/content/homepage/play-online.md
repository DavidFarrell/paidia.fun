##### Play on Tabletopia

You can [play our game on Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/games/european-bioinvasions-raccoon-68a54u/play-now). It's completely free. It should work on most computers in most web browsers. 

We find it works best in Chrome. It's hard to play with a trackpad so try to find a mouse if you can.

The online version doesn't implement the rules of the game, you'll need to [read the instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z0nuwHCUakSrsgYdLL-4yxsbPCS07mtLirmmnm7J-3s/edit?usp=sharing) and manage the game yourself.  It isn't so hard once you get the hangover.  

Soon we will make a wee video showing how to play online.
